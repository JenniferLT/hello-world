# hello-world
This is an introduction to who I am and why I would like to learn to code.
Hello Everyone! My name is Jennifer. I live in Simpsonville, South Carolina. I am currently a media specialist in the Greenville County School District. I don't really know anything about coding and I would love to learn! I believe that learning code will be beneficial in my future career endeavors.
